"""
Goal Tracker for Toronto Maple Leafs
This script tracks the Toronto Maple Leafs' games using the NHL API and triggers actions such as playing sounds on a Sonos speaker and activating a goal light via Home Assistant webhooks.
Modules:
    - requests: For making HTTP requests to the NHL API and Home Assistant webhooks.
    - time: For adding delays between API calls.
    - json: For parsing JSON responses from the NHL API.
    - pytz: For timezone conversions.
    - sys: For redirecting stdout and stderr to a log file.
    - soco: For controlling Sonos speakers.
    - datetime: For handling date and time operations.
Constants:
    - TORONTO_TEAM_ID: The team ID for the Toronto Maple Leafs.
    - HTTP_STATUS_OK: HTTP status code for a successful request.
    - TIMEZONE: The timezone for the game times.
    - SONOS_IP: The IP address of the Sonos speaker.
    - RASPPI_IP: The IP address of the Raspberry Pi running the webserver.
    - SOUND_GAME_START_FILE: The file path for the game start sound.
    - SOUND_GOAL_HORN_FILE: The file path for the goal horn sound.
Global Variables:
    - game_is_live: Boolean indicating if a game is currently live.
    - game_about_to_start: Boolean indicating if a game is about to start.
    - game_in_intermission: Boolean indicating if a game is in intermission.
    - toronto_is_home: Boolean indicating if Toronto is the home team.
    - toronto_score: The current score of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
    - opponent_score: The current score of the opponent team.
    - game_today: Boolean indicating if there is a game today.
    - sonos: The global Sonos speaker object.
Functions:
    - get_opponent_team_name(game, home_team_id): Returns the name of the opponent team.
    - get_apiweb_nhl_data(endpoint): Makes a GET request to the NHL API and returns the JSON response.
    - get_boxscore_data(gameId): Retrieves and parses the boxscore data for a given game ID.
    - get_playbyplay_data(gameId): Retrieves and parses the play-by-play data for a given game ID.
    - current_toronto_game(): Determines if Toronto is playing today and returns the game ID if applicable.
    - activate_goal_light(message): Sends a POST request to the Home Assistant webhook to activate the goal light.
    - notify_game_about_to_start(message): Sends a POST request to the Home Assistant webhook to notify that the game is about to start.
    - check_scores(boxscore_data): Checks the current scores and triggers actions if there has been a recent goal.
    - start_game(): Resets the scores and sets the game as live when it starts.
    - play_sounds(sound_file): Plays a sound on the Sonos speaker.
    - goal_tracker_main(): The main function that runs the goal tracker.
Usage:
    Run the script to start tracking the Toronto Maple Leafs' games. The script will log its output to a specified log file and continuously check for game updates.
